# Living with the Legacy

Every time we build something, we learn and improve our methods, 
however anything we've built in the past can be difficult to improve, modify or even trust. 
How can we take old scary code, and make it something we can be proud of?

## Code Examples

Source code for each of the code examples is included.
This source code is entirely untested, please don't hurt yourself on them.
